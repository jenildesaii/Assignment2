                Wrap me up in all your ,| want ya<br>
                <span class="happy"></span>In my arms, oh, let me hold ya<br>
                 I'll never let you go again, like I did<br>
                  Oh, I used to say</span><br><br>
                <span class="sad"></span>"I would never fall in love again until I found her"<br>
                 I said, "I would never fall unless it's you I fall into"<br>
                 I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her<br>
                  I found you</span><br><br>
                Heaven, when I held you again<br>
                 How could we ever just be friends?<br>
                 <span class="sad">I would rather die than let you go<br>
                Juliet to your Romeo<br>
                 How I heard you say</span><br><br>
